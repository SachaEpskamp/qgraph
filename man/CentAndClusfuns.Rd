\title{
Centrality and Clustering plots and tables
}
\description{
These functions can be used to facilitate interpreting centrality and clustering coefficients. The plot functions use ggplot2 (Wickham, 2009). The table functions create a long format table which can easilly be plotted in ggplot2.
}
\usage{
centralityPlot(..., labels, scale = c("z-scores", "raw", "raw0","relative"),
                 include = c("Degree","Strength","OutDegree","InDegree","OutStrength","InStrength",
                 "Closeness","Betweenness"), theme_bw = TRUE, print = TRUE, verbose = TRUE, 
                 standardized, relative, weighted = TRUE, signed = TRUE)
clusteringPlot(..., scale = c("z-scores", "raw", "raw0","relative"), labels, 
                  include , signed = FALSE, theme_bw = TRUE, print = TRUE,
                  verbose = TRUE, standardized, relative,orderBy = "default", 
                  decreasing = FALSE)
centralityTable(..., labels, standardized = TRUE,  relative = FALSE, weighted =
                 TRUE, signed = TRUE)
clusteringTable(..., labels,  standardized = TRUE, relative = FALSE, 
                signed = FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{\dots}{
Objects usuable in the \code{\link{getWmat}} generic, such as qgraph objects and weights matrices. Can also be lists containing these objects. Graphs in a list will be plotted in the same panel as different lines and graphs in seperate arguments will be plotted in seperate panels.
}
\item{scale}{Scale of the x-axis. \code{"z-scores"} to plot standardized coefficients, \code{"raw"} to plot raw coefficients, \code{"raw0"} to plot raw coefficients while including 0 on the x-axis and  \code{"relative"} to show values on a relative scale from 0 (lowest) to 1 (highest).}
  \item{labels}{
A vector overwriting the labels used. Can be missing.
}
  \item{include}{
A vector of measures to include. if missing all measures available will be included. Not included by default are \code{"ExpectedInfluence"}, \code{"OutExpectedInfluence"}, and \code{"InExpectedInfluence"}
}
\item{theme_bw}{
Adds the ggplot2 black and white theme to the plot
}
\item{print}{
  If \code{TRUE}, the plot is sent to the print command and returned invisible, if \code{FALSE} the plot is returned normally. Needed to include plots in e.g., pdf files.
}
\item{verbose}{
Should messages be printed to the console?
}
  \item{standardized}{
Logical, should all measures be standardized? Argument is deprecated and will be removed.
}
  \item{relative}{
Logical, should all measures be scaled relative to the largest value? Argument is deprecated and will be removed.
}
\item{weighted}{Logical, set to \code{FALSE} to set all edge weights to 1 or -1}
\item{signed}{Logical, set to \code{FALSE} to make all edge weights absolute}
\item{orderBy}{String indicating which measure to order by. Can be default (alphabetical), or one of the measures plotted (e.g., \code{"Strength"})}
\item{decreasing}{Logical indicating if the nodes should be ordered increasing or decreasing}
}

\details{
Note that under default setting the plot functions show the standardized centrality indices. That is, z-scores instead of raw centrality indices. This is done to allow easier comparison of multiple networks.
